# biger-fx
A desktop UI tool that uses Biger API access token to perform various operations.

This is not a fully featured product (yet at least) that can do the full gamut of operations including placing of orders or checking of balance. It is for now mainly intended for users
to perform simple testing to check if their access token is working.

It can run on any OS that the jdk supports (just compile and run it). For convenience, we will also release a packaged zip for windows users (.bat to execute)
